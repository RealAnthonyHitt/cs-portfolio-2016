             <p>hello internet! Welcome to my new website! This website was made
              in order to keep track of my agenda for the year in intro to COM-SCI. As you can see, the following tabs on the page above this text indicate what I will be working on for the year. Check them out as soon as they're updated!</p>
              
              <p>work since Round 1: officially completed both the about me page & the hardware page, begun work on how-to, and may edit all three as I learn more CSS.></p>

               <p> My name is Anthony Hitt, I am fifteen years old, with my birthday on March 30th, 2001. I am currently a sophomore in Summit Rainier High School. </p>
               <p>It was during the summer of 2014 that I actually began coding.
               It started when my older brother, a year older then me, was introduced to Codecademy by his teacher. After being told I should start coding but with his support, I decided to make an account on codecademy and begin coding. While I did end up expanding to other coding sites, 
               such as khan academy & freecodecamp, I struggled to get further from HTML & CSS. I decided to come to computer science, hoping that the education here would help turn that difficulty around. Things are looking on the up and up!</p>
                              <p> Summit Rainier has been an extremely important part of my coding career. I joined Summit in the year 2015, a year before I created this webpage. Here, they have provided a unique educational experience, unlike any other school i've been to, and I am very thankful for that. In Summit Rainier, computers are an integral part of your high school life, which makes a computer class like this one MUCH easier. With the advantage of a school which supports online self-development, coding became a part of the work I do here.</p>
