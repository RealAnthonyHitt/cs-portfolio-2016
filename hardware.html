         <p>This is one of my pages, and my first real project. In this project, called the Hardware page, I have included eight pieces of information, accompanied by a single image, to describe the pieces of hardware which get a computer to work. Please read, as a second page will be written to explain how the page was made, known as "How to... Hardware."</p>

     <td>The motherboard is a large Printed Circuit Board. It is covered with slots which fit different needs, such as a power connector which allows the entire computer to turn on, and a CPU socket, which holds the computer's CPU.
     The purpose of the motherboard is to allow communication with all the parts of the computer(seen below.)
        The motherboard is like the backbone of computers, it holds together every part of the computer that makes it work. </td>

         The CPU is located within the motherboard, held by a CPU socket. In the motherboard, ALL data eventually has to run through the CPU in order to send that data or execute that program.

             RAM
         </td>
         <td>
             <p>Random Access Memory, or RAM for short, is the most widely known form of computer memory. It is like the temporary storage bin of your computer, when you perform activities such as opening applications, you are using RAM. When you eventually turn off the computer, the data in the RAM is either lost, or moved to a hard drive to be permanently stored. </p>
<p>
        The earliest form of RAM is the Magnetic-Core memory. Created in 1947, data is stored on magnetic rings for only 1 bit per ring. To put that into perspective, a single gigabyte of RAM is equal to 8 and a half billion bits. The Mag-core memory was eventually made obsolete when the Dynamic-RAM was invented, with which the size of computers was decreased and far more bits of data could be stored.

         </td>
         <td><p>The Hard drive disk, or HDD, is a mechanical part of a computer tasked with reading and writing data. It is done through the use of a mechanical arm which uses a read/write head to do such with data on a storage platter. You can compare a hard drive to walking across a room to get a book off a shelf. </p>

             <h2>>BUS</h2>
         </td>
         <td>BUS is physical circuitry of the data connections between each part of a computer. Its purpose is to connect the CPU, the memory, and the other parts of the computer such as the keyboard, together. It also works to increase the amount of data-information transmitted between the components of the computer at the same time, described in width. It also reduces the number of “pathways” needed to communicate to each component. The BUS is very much like an actual bus for computers, it moves people in one bus rather then multiple cars.

             Keyboard
         </td>
         <td>The keyboard is an input device which uses keys to enter data into another device. The computer keyboard is more known specifically as a QWERTY keyboard, after the first six letters on it. Keyboards and their keys are applied to computers by writing the data

The keys on the keyboard originate from the famous “typewriter,” an electromechanical device which printed movable-block letters onto paper. But typewriters go even further then that. The printing press was invented in the late 1400s by Johann Gutenberg, which functioned very differently from keyboards & typewriters, with massive wood-blocks as letters to print and having to organize all the letters before creating a page.

             Mouse

         <td>A computer mouse is a device controlled by a user to simulate a 2-dimensional motion of a pointer/clicker on a user interface. A standard mouse include two buttons, a scroll wheel, and a method of moving a pointer/clicker, like moving.
There are many variants of the mouse, and the parts on them. Some computer mice have a scroll wheel, while others do not. A popular type of mouse is the track-ball mouse, which replaces manual hand-motions to 2-dimensionally move a clicker. The Razer is a brand of keypads and mice, and they produce certain computer mice which are dedicated to playing fast-paced games, and come with certain keys for self-binding and even arrow keys. There is even a simple trackpad, where all the actions of a mouse are controlled exclusively by your fingers.

         <td>The computer monitor is the visual screen of any given computer. It is both the only and the most essential part for visual communication between a user and a computer
The monitor was once believed to create visible movement on a computer. This is not true. It is rather the limits of human eyesight which create the illusion of movement. To elaborate, the monitors of today are what is known as a liquid crystal display(LCD), the liquid crystal display is made up of layers of different materials, first a polarizing filter for controlling the reflection, then the electrodes which create the shapes on the screen, a second polarizing filter, and a reflective surface to send the image back to the viewer.
